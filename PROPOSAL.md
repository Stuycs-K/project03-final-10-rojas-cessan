# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Nelli Rojas-Cessa
       
# Intentions:

The main objective of this project is to create a chat program that allows users on different computers to send messages and files back and forth, like the well-known application, Messenger. Two or multiple users can join a chatroom at a time using a randomly generated password to get access. Each user has a username. There is also a chat log that records the entire chat history. Users are also able to send files or images through the chat.

    
# Intended usage:

The chat program will operate on Terminal and display previous messages both sent and received by the user. To join a chatroom, the program will ask for a password and their username to ensure that they are a verified user. Each user will have their username displayed above their own messages. Messages will be color coded, and the background will also be customizable. Once a chat ends because someone disconnected, the chat log file can be used to read the entire chat history. To send images or files, the user would have to use a special command, which will be specified on the interface. 

  
# Technical Details:

The chat program will mainly utilize the following concepts from class: working with files, when transferring files and to see the chat log; sockets and networking to send messages back and forth; and semaphores to ensure users can send information at the same time without complications. The TCP handshake will be used initially to ensure a connection. Then sockets will be used in a client-server connection so that users can chat from different IP addresses. Semaphores will then be used to make sure there isnâ€™t odd behavior when multiple users send messages at the same time and possible as an add-on to set permissions settings for certain users. A file is also created and written to as someone sends a message, which would be the chat log. For file transfer, sockets will also be used. 
    
# Intended pacing:

January 8: Basic chat function between two/multiple users
January 9: User interface 
January 10: Chat log
January 12: Add-ons like sending files/images
January 15: Finishing touches like colors and backgrounds
